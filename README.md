This project implemnts the Chord protocol, was seen in the `chord.pdf` file. 


To run this project, run the make `make` command in your terminal. The `Makefile` will compile `node.cpp` into `node`, run node, and return all outputs to the file called `output.txt`. 


The `main()` function of the `node.cpp` file runs the test case provided in `test-case.pdf`. This implmentation also includes the `leave()` function.
